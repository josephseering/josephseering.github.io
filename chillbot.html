		<h1>Chillbot moderation study</h1>
		
		This study, which focuses on understanding the potential utility of private, non-punitive nudges in correcting user behavior, is being run in the HCI group in the Computer Science Department at Stanford University under the supervision of Michael Bernstein and Joseph Seering. 
		We are recruiting moderators who are interested in adding a bot to their Discord servers for a set period of time, after which they will participate in brief interviews about whether, when, and how the bot was useful.
		See below for a brief video clip showing the core functionality of the bot.

		This bot does not scrape and store user conversations on servers where it is installed, and it cannot perform moderation functions beyond the prompted messaging function shown in the clip above (e.g., deleting messages or banning users). It will not interfere with the function of any other preexisting bots on the server.
		Further information about the study and associated compensation is available as part of the recruitment and onboarding process.
